Description: This package for determining Personalized Dosing Interval in the cases where there is one continuous treatment but the dosages needs to personalized.  we propose two approaches, Probability Dosing Interval(PDI) and Expectation Dosing Interval(EDI). The former yields a potential outcome which is greater than a specific value with a certain probability, the latter allows the expectation of the potential outcome to be greater than a specific value.  According to the assumption of the potential outcome, one can choose to estimate the lower boundary, upper boundary, or both boundary of the interval.
